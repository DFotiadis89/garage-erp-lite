# garage-erp-lite

**Modular ERP for automotive repair shops**, built from scratch as a learning and portfolio project.  
Initially developed for self-hosting on a Raspberry Pi cluster, with the goal of cloud migration and production-readiness.

## üöó Project Goals

- Build a modular, containerized ERP tailored for **automotive service garages**
- Start with **Raspberry Pi deployment**, migrate to **cloud infrastructure** (e.g. Azure)
- Showcase practical experience with:
  - .NET Web API development
  - Docker + Kubernetes orchestration
  - CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
  - Infrastructure observability (logging, metrics, dashboards)
- Prioritize clean code, modular architecture, and production-relevant practices
- Publish project publicly with documentation and deployment walkthroughs
